can at any time opt-out from collection of telemetry.

#### Application-Level

* Version number (e.g. 1.0.x)
* Location (country and city)
* Features used by the user
  * Data collected from features only identified the event taking place such as 
    Created Rule, Deleted Filter. No telemetry identifying the data itself is collected. 
    This gives the developer insight into what features that are actually being used 
    and helps focus future development.

### External data sources

#### OS information and IP address

When Ghostly makes web requests to https://github.com to retrieve data, it includes user's 
machine's OS information in the User-Agent header. The author of Ghostly does not have 
access to this information, but the website https://github.com does and it logs this 
information. The website will also log user's IP address. Again, the author of Ghostly 
does not have access to this data.

#### Third-party data source

When user specifies a different data source than the default source at https://github.com,

such data to its author.
